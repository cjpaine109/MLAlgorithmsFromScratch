To compute the size of the steps determined by the learning rate, we use the following equation:

  "Step = θ − learning rate × gradients"

Where:
    -> θ: the current parameters (theta in this case)
    -> learning rate: the size of the step
    -> gradients: the current slope of the convex function (Mean Squared Error, or MSE, loss function)
