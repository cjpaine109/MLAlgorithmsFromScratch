# Comparing Gradient Descent Algorithms

This repository contains basic implementations of Gradient Descent Algorithms: Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent. These implementations are basic and can be adjusted as needed!

## Description

In this project, we compute the parameters of a Simple Linear Regression model using various Gradient Descent methods.

## Files

- `gradient_descent_algorithms.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the various algorithms.
- `interactive_visualization.py`: Python file containing code for interactive visualization of the convergence process (training).
- `Summary.txt`: Simple text file containing general information about these algorithms.
- `README.md`: Documentation of the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic knowledge of Linear Regression and Python programming

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cjpaine109/ai-notebooks.git
    cd ai-notebooks
    ```

2. **Install necessary packages**:
    Ensure you have the required Python packages installed. You can use `pip` to install them:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
    ```

3. **Open Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

### Usage

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Comparing Gradient Descent Algorithms
    ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
    Open `gradient_descent_algorithms.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to run and explore the main code.
    Use `interactive_visualization.py` to dynamically visualize the convergence process.

## Note
